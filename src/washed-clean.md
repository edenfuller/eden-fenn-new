## Washed Clean

### published in Nature Futures in March 2020

The record of my sins is written on every cell.

“Before we can move forward,” says Sister Ruth, “I need to make sure you’re fully committed. You’ll only have this opportunity once.”

I nod, a gesture I hope is demure, betraying no annoyance. I wouldn’t have called her back if I wasn’t sure.

Two photographs rest on the steel desk that divides us. Sister Ruth points at the one on her right, my left. “This is Anette Whitman. She never understood the harm in living by her own rules. She didn’t see the point in faith. She got along fine this way for years, but with only her own moral compass to guide her, she went further and further astray. Now she’s a drug dealer facing a prison sentence, unemployable, with no future. A dead-end woman.”

I glance up from my folded hands to look at the photo. My own grainy mugshot stares back at me.

Sister Ruth fixes her gaze on me until I meet her eyes, then indicates the other photo. “This is Anne White.”

The woman in it could be my distant relative, or a picture of me drawn from a verbal description. She’s wearing a head covering identical to Sister Ruth’s—shaped like a nun’s, but baby blue.

Mom raised me Catholic. She had a wayward phase in her twenties and made her share of mistakes, including me. When it was time to get her life back on track, she did the prodigal son routine and returned to everything she’d left: her parents, her faith, her church. If we were still talking, me joining this “cult” might make her disown me all over again. But the New Church offers a more practical form of absolution.

“Anne is an acolyte of the New Church. She’s forgotten her selfish ways and left her old life behind. She works every day to atone for her sins. And in recognition of that atonement, the Church has given her a new start. Her past has been erased.”

My “selfish ways” began with a stray social media post. A Church-backed state delegate said some unsavory things about a woman’s place, so I said some unsavory things about that delegate. I figured he’d block me and that would be the end of it.

It was a lazy act of dissent, the kind of thing people used to do without thinking twice, but the rules were changing more quickly than I knew. The next day I arrived at the coffee shop for my shift and found myself out of a job. My ex-boss showed me a tablet screen displaying a citizen record, where my vulgar comment was displayed next to my social security number and the drop of blood taken as part of my background check when I was hired.

Worse, the social network had surrendered my private message history to the Feds. A curated selection of chats with my friends and girlfriend were displayed in my record as well, ranging from much more candid commentary on current events to lewd photos I’d sent when Kat was studying abroad. The portrait of a degenerate. From that day forward, it was all there for any prospective employer to see.

I found a couple more jobs after that, back-of-house work at the filthiest kitchens in the city with the filthiest managers, nowhere I could stand to stay for long. Soon that pattern of quick turnover was part of my record as well. For the past eighteen months I’ve made my living outside of traditional employment, any way I could. Now that’s caught up with me too.

“So,” Sister Ruth asks, “which of these women do you want to be?”

I nod toward the woman with a future, the woman with no past.

“Very good.” Ruth smiles and turns to the correctional officer. “You can release her to my care.”

I sign the papers as Ruth drives me to the baptism. I agree never to contact anyone from my old life again. But there’s no one to contact: I broke things off with Kat before she could be dragged down with me. Most of my old friends have gone silent, not wanting my acquaintance on their records. And I’ve made new friends these past few months, friends who will find a way to reach me. There are always back channels.

At the Church’s rebirthing center, I lie on a baby blue table suspended over the baptismal pool. The priest reads the words of the rite as the anesthesiologist secures my breathing mask and IV.

Ruth’s smile is the last thing I see as I’m lowered into the thick, milky fluid. “We’ll see you soon, Anne.”

In the baptismal pool, my cells will rebuild themselves, my DNA rewritten so I can never be identified as Annette Whitman again. It’s the only way my record can be expunged. When I wake, I won’t recognize my own face in the mirror. But I’ll be reborn, made new, my past behind me. My sins washed clean.

In exchange, I’ll owe the Church seven years of mandatory service. Seven years to study them from the inside, to learn their secrets, to share everything I find. I’ll be a cleverer sinner, this time. I will learn the rules of this new world; I’ll do my dissent in secret. I will find the places the all-seeing eye isn’t looking. They won’t catch me again.
